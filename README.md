# File Metadata Microservice

This is the boilerplate for the File Metadata Microservice project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice

I [Tanuke Sensei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanukesensei/) developed the code so that the api would work correctly, both for personal training in creating APIs and for obtaining the course certificate.
